          I have a passion and curiosity for learning new technologies, and
          understanding how different software systems are designed. I am
          currently focusing on the Internet of Things and learning full-stack
          development. I am proficient in front-end technologies, but also
          dabble in the backend side of systems as well. I gained my current
          technical skills from school, and learning new technologies through
          online courses.

          During my free time I play video games, read about technology trends (AI trends, and other technological breakthroughs (nuclear fission, space, and biological research))

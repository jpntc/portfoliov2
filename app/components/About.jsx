          Hello, my name is Jude Pierre, a computer science student who loves
          everything about software engineering. I have a passion and curiosity
          for learning new technologies, and understanding how different
          software systems are designed. I am currently focusing on the Internet
          of Things and learning full-stack development. I am proficient in
          front-end technologies, but also dabble in the backend side as well.

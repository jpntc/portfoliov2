          I started my degree in 2021, at CUNY Queens College. There I took
          multiple classes that thought theoretical and practical courses in the
          field of computer science. I learnt web development mainly outside of
          class, and know enough to build full-stack applications. Some
          certificates I have earned online include:
        </p>
        {/* <div className="">TAB BUTTON TO DISPLAY COURSES HERE.</div> */}
      </div>

  );
